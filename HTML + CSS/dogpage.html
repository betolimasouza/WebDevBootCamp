    <h2>Hachikō</h2>
    <p>
        Hachikō was an Akita dog born on a farm near the city of Ōdate, Akita Prefecture, Japan. He is remembered for his remarkable
        loyalty to his owner, for whom he continued to wait for over nine years following his death.
        <br> Hachikō is known in Japanese as chūken Hachikō (忠犬ハチ公) "faithful dog Hachikō", hachi meaning "eight" and kō meaning
        "affection." During his lifetime, the dog was held up in Japanese culture as an example of loyalty and fidelity.
        <br> Well after his death, he continues to be remembered in worldwide popular culture, with statues, movies, books, and
        appearances in various media
